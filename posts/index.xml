      <description>The Idea After brainstorming for a while for a project that would be very useful to my day to day life but not overly ambitious, I came up with the idea of a mobile workout tracker. The apps available now are too bloated and overly complicated for my needs, and often quite slow in saving workouts.

      <description>Testing! This blog was created by following this great tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIFvgrRxdt4. It was insightful to see how github submodules can be used to seamlessly host sites off github pages, and how easy it is to create nice looking blogs with Hugo. I created an organisation called Cheukblog so that I can have the URL of the blog: &amp;ldquo;cheukblog.github.io&amp;rdquo;. All this was done in around 30 minutes, great for a simplistic blog.</description>
